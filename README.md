# Invoice System in Google Docs
This is an invoice system I wrote and maintained in 2012-2014. Written in Google Apps Script (JavaScript cloud framework). There were many interesting functions, like:
\n• custom menu in Google Docs
• creating pre-invoices and invoices from templates
• printing into PDF
• input popup forms
• record of orders - Google Sheets used like a (manually/programmaticaly editable) database
• recognizing which worker is using the app
• XLSX export

The code is richly commented mostly in the Czech language including a changelog and a bugtracker. All sheet IDs, e-mail addresses etc. were anonymized.
